## The Build Pipeline (`/build`)

The `/build` skill orchestrates the full feature implementation lifecycle. Paste a PRD or feature spec and it handles everything.

### How it works

```
PRD → [Plan] → [User Q&A] → [Implement] → [Review] → Done
```

#### Step 1: Two-Phase Planning (with user input)

The planning step is split into **discovery** and **generation** so the planner can ask you questions before committing to a plan.

**Step 1a — Discovery**
The `prd-task-planner` agent explores the codebase and writes `tasks/planning-questions.md` with:
- A summary of what it found in the codebase (architecture, existing features, relevant code)
- 3-8 questions about architectural decisions, scope, and integration choices that would materially change the plan

**Step 1b — User Q&A**
The build orchestrator reads the questions file and presents them to you interactively. You answer each question.

**Step 1c — Generation**
The same planner agent is **resumed** (keeping all its codebase exploration context) with your answers. It then generates:
- `tasks/updated-prd.md` — the PRD refined with codebase context
- `tasks/task-01-*.md`, `task-02-*.md`, ... — ordered, self-contained task files

#### Step 2: Parallel Implementation

The `parallel-task-orchestrator` reads all task files, builds a dependency graph, and spawns `task-implementer` agents in parallel waves.

#### Step 3: Code Review

The `code-reviewer` audits all changes against `tasks/updated-prd.md` and produces a compliance report.

### Usage

```
/build <paste your PRD here>
```

Or reference a file:
```
/build $(cat path/to/prd.md)
```

### Running agents individually

You can also invoke agents directly via the Task tool:

```
# Just plan (discovery + generate in one shot, no Q&A pause)
Task: prd-task-planner — "Here's the PRD: ... Output tasks to tasks/"

# Just implement
Task: parallel-task-orchestrator — "Execute all tasks from tasks/"

# Just review
Task: code-reviewer — "Review changes against tasks/updated-prd.md"
```

When invoked directly (outside `/build`), the `prd-task-planner` runs all phases end-to-end without the Q&A pause. The two-phase flow only activates when the prompt includes `MODE: DISCOVERY` or `MODE: GENERATE`.

## Agent Memory

Each agent has persistent memory in `.claude/agent-memory/<agent-name>/`. Agents record codebase patterns, conventions, and insights they discover. This builds institutional knowledge across sessions — e.g., the planner remembers your project structure so future planning is faster.
